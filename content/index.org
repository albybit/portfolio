* whoami ...?
I invite you to explore my background, experiences, interests, and passions—allowing them to form a clear picture of who I am. Let the story unfold, dear reader.

** my timeline
*** 2016-2020 University
**** Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Engineering:
I earned my Bachelor’s Degree from the Polytechnic of Turin, Italy, where I honed my skills in computing fundamentals and problem solving. 
**** Master’s Degree in Cybersecurity:
this program, still in progress, has been instrumental in deepening my understanding of network security, cryptography, and risk management.
*** 2021-2022 Pandemic Times
**** Frontline Contributions
During the challenging period of the pandemic, while still enrolled at university, I was recruited by local authorities to support the vaccination campaign and enforce isolation procedures.
***** Skill Development
This experience was transformative—it sharpened my soft skills and taught me how to manage a wide range of situations, especially when dealing with individuals attempting to bypass protocols or exploit benefits (unlawfully getting a vaccine or a discount on isolation time).
*** 2022 - today
I currently work for an Italian institution, where I balance dual responsibilities as a software developer and project manager. 


** currently carrying on:
*** small personal projects
I am actively involved in small personal projects. I am trying to build a small crypto walelt for android
**** Lifelong Learning:
I am dedicated to self-improvement both professionally and personally. Whether it's reviewing C++ or delving into cybersecurity topics for my academic career, I remain committed to growth and exploration.
*** personal growth
practcing ashtanga yoga and meditating.
** favourite tech
 I appreciate the elegance of tools like Emacs (currently running Emacs 27.1 with Org mode 9.3). I continuously enjoy learning and experimenting, even deploying my website with a simple push via GitHub Actions—a testament to my evolving proficiency with modern development workflows.
